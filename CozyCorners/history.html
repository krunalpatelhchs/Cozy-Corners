				<p> 
					Mrs. Cochran began teaching full-time at Hardin County High School in the fall of 1985. 
					She taught Vocational Home Economics - Adult Living, Foods and Nutrition and Housing. 
					Students and members of the community had expressed an interest in offering food management training for students. 
					The administration and she decided to request grant funding to convert the home economics classroom, 3 home kitchen units, living area and bathroom into a commercial food service kitchen and small restaurant area for serving customers. 
					They received the grant funding and began purchasing equipment and making the structural conversions during the summer of 1987. 
					The 1987-88 school year was a learning experience for both students and teacher as they dealt with all the issues and regulations that come up when you open a new restaurant. 
					They had a schoolwide contest to name the student-operated restaurant. 
					Many, many suggestions were submitted and students voted. 
					Cozy Corners Cafe' was selected as the name for the restaurant. 
					Cloth tablecloths and napkins adorned the tables as students served lunch guests from both inside and outside Hardin County High School. 
					Students in Food Management class (as it was called at that time) rotated through all jobs within the operation of Cozy Corners. 
					A wide variety of items was served. Some of the favorites included Parmesan Chicken, homemade yeast rolls, Lasagna, Pizza Casserole, Burgers, Poppy Seed Chicken, and Peanut Butter Pie among many others. 
					Many students from the early years tell her they still have and use their recipe cards that they made each week for the menu items being served in Cozy Corners.
