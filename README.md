# Cozy-Corners Read Me

## Our Process

For this website we first decided what pages we were going to add. Then we gathered the information from the instructor of Cozy Corners, and also got the history from the creator of Cozy Corners.

Next, we started putting the pages together. We built the website in a mobile viewpoint, then expanded towards a desktop version.

We tested the site with chrome developer tools to see if it was responsive.

## Our Struggles 

It took some time to add in the 3 line navigation bar for mobile and make it functional but we did it.

We also had trouble making the sticky footer work for a mobile version of the site, but soon found a solution.

## Resources 

We used w3.org free to use 3 line navigation image svg.

Used google's Raleway font.

All our images that we used on the site were free to use images.

## Authors 

This site was created by Bishope Wilson, Preston Thrasher, and Krunal Patel.
